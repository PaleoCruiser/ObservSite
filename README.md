# A collection of brwoser observability scripts generated by Google's Gemini. 

Some of the pages capture errors in the windw.onerror event. Some capture page timing events.

All of them send the captured data by loading a png image where the query strnig contains the data key-value-pairs.

**Example**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/tiny.png?DOMContentLoaded=2&load=62&pageshow=63%3A%7B%22persisted%22%3Afalse%7D&visibilitychange=1111315%3A%7B%22state%22%3A%22visible%22%7D&beforeunload=1121176
```

## Instructions
Open a web page in a browser.

Ctrl+SHift+I

Look at the Network tab or the Console to see what happened.

## Going forward...

1. Add function to make it easier to log errors, timeouts, etcetera with the data that we need.
2. Create queries to read the W3 logs and start the obervability journey!
