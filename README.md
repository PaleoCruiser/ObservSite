# A collection of browser observability scripts generated by Google's Gemini. 

Some of the pages capture errors in the windw.onerror event. Some capture page timing events.

All of them send the captured data by loading a png image where the query string contains the data key-value-pairs.

**Example**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/tiny.png?DOMContentLoaded=2&load=62&pageshow=63%3A%7B%22persisted%22%3Afalse%7D&visibilitychange=1111315%3A%7B%22state%22%3A%22visible%22%7D&beforeunload=1121176
```
Based on the query string above, here are the key-value pairs:
1. DOMContentLoaded: 2
2. load: 62
3. pageshow: 63:{"persisted":false}
4. visibilitychange: 12762:{"state":"visible"}
5. beforeunload: 31211

The **load** event fires when the browser has finished loading all content on the page, including the HTML, CSS, images, and other resources. It signifies that the page is fully ready to be interacted with by a user.

It's different from the **DOMContentLoaded** event, which only fires once the initial HTML document has been completely parsed and loaded. The load event is a much more comprehensive milestone, as it confirms that all assets are present.

**pageshow** represents the elapsed time in milliseconds since the script began to run. This indicates that the pageshow event occurred just 63 milliseconds after the page started loading. This is very fast

**visibilitychange** means this event  occurred 12,762 milliseconds (approximately 12 seconds) after the script loaded, indicating the moment the page became visible.

**beforeunload** means this event occurred 31,211 milliseconds (approximately 30 seconds) after the script loaded, indicating when the user was about to leave the page.



## Instructions
Open a web page in a browser.

Ctrl+SHift+I

Look at the Network tab or the Console to see what happened.

## Going forward...

1. Add function to make it easier to log errors, timeouts, etcetera with the data that we need.
2. Create queries to read the W3 logs and start the observability journey!
